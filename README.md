> ⚠️ **Disclaimer:** 
This Docker wrapper is _not officially developed or maintained_ by Swapplications (the creators of UHF Server).  
> I'm not affiliated with them — I just built this to make deployment easier for the community.  
>  
> I do **not** maintain the `uhf-server` script itself — only the Docker setup.  
> If you run into issues with the actual recording logic or the server code, you'll need to contact the UHF devs directly.  
>  
> For bugs, suggestions, or Docker-related issues, please **open an Issue or PR on GitHub**. Reddit and Discord DMs won't be monitored.

> **Note:** This README and repository are built with Docker Compose in mind. While other methods of running the container may work, they are not officially supported and are up to the user to figure out.

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. Clone this repo and start the container:

    ```bash
    # Clone this repo
    git clone https://github.com/solid-pixel/uhf-server-docker

    # Navigate to the directory
    cd uhf-server-docker

    # Start the container
    docker compose up -d
    ```

2. Open UHF, go to the Recordings tab, and add:

    - SERVER ADDRESS: `<your-host-ip>`
    - SERVER PORT: `8000` (or the port you set up in `docker-compose.yml`)

## ⚙️ Customization

The following environment variables can be configured in `docker-compose.yml`:
- **API_HOST**: Bind to all interfaces (default: `0.0.0.0`)
- **API_PORT**: Default API port inside container (default: `8000`) - changing this might break healthchecks
- **RECORDINGS_DIR**: Location for recordings (default: `/var/lib/uhf-server/recordings`)
- **DB_PATH**: Path to database file (default: `/var/lib/uhf-server/db.json`)
- **LOG_LEVEL**: Logging verbosity (default: `INFO`) - (DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, CRITICAL)
- **ENABLE_COMMERCIAL_DETECTION**: Enable automatic commercial detection after recordings (default: `false`) — uses [`comskip`](https://github.com/erikkaashoek/Comskip), already installed in this image
- **PASSWORD**: (optional) Passes `--password $PASSWORD` to `uhf-server` if set

You can set these variables in three ways:
1. Directly in the `docker-compose.yml` file (uncomment the environment section)
2. In a `.env` file placed in the same directory as your `docker-compose.yml`
3. As environment variables in your shell before running `docker compose up`

You can also customize:
- **Storage location:** adjust the `volumes:` path in `docker-compose.yml`
- **Port mapping:** change `8000:8000` to `YOUR_PORT:8000` in `docker-compose.yml` to use a different external port
- **Auto-restart:** enabled via `restart: unless-stopped` in `docker-compose.yml`
- **Health checks:** container health is monitored every 30s via `/server/stats` endpoint
- **Recordings folder:** override only the recordings directory by uncommenting `./uhf-recordings:/var/lib/uhf-server/recordings` in `docker-compose.yml` (optional; in addition to the main data mount)

## 🖥️ Running on Unraid and TrueNAS SCALE

If you’re not using Docker Compose, make sure to set the container’s command to `uhf-server` manually in the UI. These platforms don’t use `docker-compose.yml`, so the default entrypoint won’t be applied. Without this, the server won’t start.
